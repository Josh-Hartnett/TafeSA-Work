	<section><!--This section includes the main portion for the home page. It is separated by 
	using div elements, which split the services into two columns. This was done to reduce
	'death by scroll', while keeping the page presentable.
	
	First, is the introduction to Tranquil services, which includes a <hr /> element to help
	the user distinguish the different parts of the page. -->
		<h1 id="firstHeading" class="blueTxt">Read about our services below</h1>

		<!--The div 'leftside' begins. This div is used to keep three of the services to the left 
		side of the page. After this, I use collapsible divs to let the user decide what they would
		like to see more of. This way, users get to interact with the page and choose what to display.-->
